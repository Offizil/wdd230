            <p> The Rule of Thirds a great way to look at the layout of a design 
                (be it a web page, a painting or a photograph). The idea is straightforward; 
                you place a simple grid overlay (divided equally into thirds, both horizontally and vertically) 
                on the space to be used for the design. This makes a grid of nine equal-shaped boxes. 
                To do this, we make two sets of parallel lines at even places over a background. So, 
                going from the top left, measure the width of your background. If youâ€™ve got a width 
                of 36 cm, mark out points at 12 cm and 24 cm. Then, look at the height. So, again going 
                from the top left, measuring down, we get a reading of 24 cm. Therefore, mark out points 
                at 8-cm intervals (8 cm and 16 cm down). Now that we have our grid points set, we can make the grid!
                The above website - substack.com employs this principle in a very sleek fashion by 
                aligning their most important banner image in between the 4 hot zones.

            <p>Hick's law states that the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number 
                and complexity of choice. its usually best not to make choices too 
                many so as not confused the customer
                simplicity is always best. The paradox of choice especially
                 comes into action here. Avoid overwhelming users by highlighting
                  recommended options. Be careful not to simplify to the point of abstraction.
                  Use progressive onboarding to minimize cognitive load for new users. The screenshot 
                  above shows a very simplistic and minimalistic aproach used  by Better on their landing page. 
                  simple yet classy, such that the user seem overwhelmed with choice of action or comprehension of
                  whats going on in the viewport.

                Fitts' law states that the amount of time required for a person to move a pointer 
                (e.g., mouse cursor) to a  target area is a function of the distance to the target
                divided by the size of the target. Thus, the longer the 
                distance and the smaller the target's size, the longer it takes.Touch 
                targets should be large enough for users to accurately select them.Touch targets 
                should have ample spacing between them and should 
                be placed in areas of an interface that allow them to be easily acquired.
                the screenshot above from interactive design foundation displays fitts law in a subtle way,
                 notice how the clickable elements (join us and cite this article) are made large enough for easy
                  clicking. this is especially important in the context of mobile design since the touch pointer here is
                   the fingers as opposed to the traditional cursor pointers seen in desktop screen and PCs
